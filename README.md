This repository provides the implementation and examples from our paper on ensuring Lipschitz continuity for optimization-based controllers by reformulating Quadratic Programs (QPs) as **Second-Order Cone Programs (SOCPs)**.

## üîç Motivation
Optimization-based controllers, such as those derived from constrained QPs, are powerful tools for controlling dynamical systems. However, when multiple constraints are involved, the resulting control law $\pi_{\rm qp}$ may lack regularity properties like Lipschitz continuity. This lack of continuity can result in:
- Discontinuous control inputs,
- chattering behavior in closed-loop systems,
- Non-unique or ill-posed system trajectories.


To address this, we propose a novel **SOCP reformulation** that ensures Lipschitz continuity of the control law, *regardless of the structure of the constraint matrices*.


## üß© Key Features
‚úÖ Guaranteed Lipschitz continuity of the optimizer $\pi_{\rm socp}$

‚úÖ Closed-form solution, unlike generic multi-constraint QPs

‚úÖ Faster computation, enabling real-time deployment

‚úÖ Independence from constraint regularity (e.g., no need for linearly independent gradients)

## üìÅ In This Repo
- The main script is `main.ipynb`, which includes two working examples.
- Additional notebooks `example_1.nb` and `example_2.nb` provide more detailed analysis and visualizations of the two examples in the main script.


## üìà How to Use
To get started, open the main script `main.ipynb`. This notebook demonstrates how to use the `LipschitzControllers` module to convert general QPs into our Lipschitz-continuous SOCP formulation. 
Two example problems are included to illustrate the performance and structure of the controller. 

### Examples
We provide two examples whose original QPs admit non-Lipschitz minimizers (as shown in the animations below) and show that our reformulations do admit Lipschitz continuous minimizers.
#### Example 1

#### Example 2
![example2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a295eb77-84f1-44e1-9362-dc1d6405a001)
